A javascript-powered password generator page that uses user-selected criteria for what the passwords characters are
Bootstrap 4 and my own stylesheet
Known Issues
Passwords generated are not entirely random as each character type is chosen sequentially


What I Learned:

Bootstrap allows you to focus on the functionality of the page, rather than spending a lot of time just making the website look the way it needs to.
Knowing Javascript and HOW to use it in it's full extent is extremely valuble and surface-level knowledge never holds up on more complex projects, such as this.



Conclusion:

I needs to study Javascript more so that I know how to use the built in features and methods so that I can confidently create powerful and dyamic webpages.
